NOTE

This directory, and the file iotivity.js are only required so the example look the way they would
outside the repository. This makes them easier to copy.

Without it, the example, in order to work, would have to

var iotivity = require( "../" );

With this hack in place, they can

var iotivity = require( "iotivity" );

and so they look exactly the way they would outside the project.

If you copy any of the examples outside the project, you need not copy this directory or the file
iotivity.js along with them. You need only npm install iotivity first.
