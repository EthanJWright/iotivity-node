Introduction
------------
This document presents a JavaScript API for the [OCF](https://openconnectivity.org) [Core Specification](https://openconnectivity.org/resources/specifications) version 1.1.0.

The OCF provides
  - the specification for the Core Framework for OCF core architecture, interfaces, protocols and services to enable the implementation of OCF profiles for IoT usages

  - Application Profiles Specification documents for the OCF profiles to enable IoT usages for different market segments such as home, industrial, healthcare, and automotive.

In OCF terminology, multiple providers and solutions can share a physical hardware *platform*. A platform may host multiple physical or virtual *devices*.
Devices are addressable endpoints of communication, and run the OCF software stack. A device may host multiple physical or virtual *resources*. A resource represents *sensors* and *actuators*.

A given sensor or actuator is represented by resource properties. A read-only resource property represents a sensorial input, whereas a read-write property represents the state of an actuator.

Resources can be accessed remotely, and can notify subscribers with data and state changes. The resources act as servers, and communication may involve different protocols like CoAP or HTTP. Resources may also be represented by devices that translate between resource-specific and standard protocols. These devices are called *gateways*, or OCF *intermediary devices*.

The devices support installable software modules called *applications*. This API is exposed on an OCF device and enables writing applications that implement resources and related business logic.

This version of the API supports OCF Resource, Device, and Platform related functionality. OCF Collections, Links and Scenes are not yet supported.

Since implementations may run on constrained hardware, examples use [ECMAScript 5.1](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/).

<a name="api-object"></a>
The API object
--------------
The API object represents an OCF stack (device) and is exposed in a platform-specific manner. As an example, on Node.js it can be obtained by requiring the package that implements this API. On other platforms, it can be exposed as a property of a global object.

```javascript
let module = 'ocf';  // use your own implementation's name
var ocf = require(module);
```
If the functionality is not supported by the platform, `require` should throw `NotSupportedError`. If there is no permission for using the functionality, `require` should throw `SecurityError`.

When `require` is successful, it MUST return an object with the following properties and methods.

|Property    |Type     |Optional |Default value | Represents  |
| ---        | ---     | ---     | ---          | ---         |
| `version`  | string  | no      | `versions.ocf` in [`package.json`](../package.json) | API version |

| Method signature                | Description                |
| ---                             | ---                        |
| [`start(mode, options)`](#ocfstart)| start the OCF stack     |
| [`stop()`](#ocfstop)            | stop the OCF stack         |

The `version` property is read only and provides the the OCF API specification, as specified in the `versions.ocf` property of [`package.json`](../package.json).

<a name="ocfstart"></a>
The `start(options)` method initializes the underlying platform and resolves with an API object providing OCF client, or server, or both client-server functionality.

The `mode` optional parameter is a string that can be `"client-server"` (by default), or `"client"`, or `"server"`.

The `options` optional parameter is an object that may contain the following properties:

|Property    |Type     |Optional |Default value |
| ---        | ---     | ---     | ---          |
| `device`   | [OcfDevice](#ocfdevice) object | yes | `undefined` |
| `platform` | [OcfPlatform](#ocfplatform) object | yes | `undefined` |

The method runs the following steps:
- Return a [`Promise`](../README.md/#promise) object `promise` and continue [in parallel](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#in-parallel).
- If the `mode` argument is `undefined`, let `mode` be `"client-server"`.
- Otherwise if the `mode` argument is not `"client"`, or `"server"`, or `"client-server"`, reject `promise` with a `TypeError` and abort these steps.
- If the `mode` parameter is `"client"`, then run the following sub-steps:
  * If `options` or `options.device` or `options.platform` are not `undefined`, reject `promise` with `NotSupportedError` and abort these steps. (Client-only device has no `platform` property, and its `device` property cannot be configured).
  * Initialize the underlying OCF stack in client mode.
  * If there is an error, reject `promise` with `OcfDeviceError` and abort these steps.
  * Let `result` be an object that implements [`OcfClient`](./client.md#ocfclient). Let `result.device` be an [`OcfDevice`](#ocfdevice) object initialized from the underlying platform.
- Otherwise if the `mode` parameter is `"server"`, then run the following sub-steps.
  * Initialize the underlying OCF stack in server mode. If `options.device` is defined, use the defined properties for initializing the OCF stack. If `options.platform` is defined, use the defined properties for initializing the OCF stack.
  * If there is an error, reject `promise` with `OcfDeviceError` and abort these steps.
  * Let `result` be a new object that implements [`OcfServer`](./server.md#ocfserver). Initialize the `result.device` and `result.platform` properties from the underlying OCF stack.
 - Otherwise if the `mode` parameter is `client-server`, then run the following sub-steps.
   * Initialize the underlying OCF stack in client-server mode. If `options.device` is defined, use the defined properties for initializing the OCF stack. If `options.platform` is defined, use the defined properties for initializing the OCF stack.
   * If there is an error, reject `promise` with `OcfDeviceError` and abort these steps.
   * Let `result` be a new object that implements both [`OcfServer`](./server.md#ocfserver) and [`OcfClient`](./client.md#ocfclient).
   * Initialize the `result.device` and `result.platform` properties from the underlying OCF stack.
- Resolve `promise` with `result`.

<a name="ocfstop"></a>
The `stop()` method frees resources in the underlying platform, so that a next invocation to `start()` is able to start the device from a clean state. After the `stop()` method returns, all properties of `ocf` should be `undefined`.

<a name="ocfdevice"></a>
### The `OcfDevice` object
Exposes information about the OCF device that runs the current OCF stack instance. All properties are read-only. Future versions of this specification will support configuring some of the values.

|Property           |Type     |Optional |Default value |Represents |
| ---               | ---     | ---     | ---          | ---       |
| `uuid`            | string  | no      | `undefined` | UUID of the device |
| `name`            | string  | yes     | `undefined` | Name of the device |
| `types`           | array of strings  | no  | `[]` | List of supported OCF device types |
| `dataModels`      | array of strings  | no  | `[]` | List of supported OCF data models |
| `coreSpecVersion` | string  | no  | `undefined` | OCF Core Specification version |

The `uuid` property is generated by the underlying OCF stack during the on-boarding process. Applications may provide this property, but it may be changed by the implementation after the device is started.

The `name` property represents the device name as provided by the application. Users can also set a free-form device name using the [configure()](./client.md/#configure) method that updates the `oic.wk.con` resource, hence does not alter `name`.

The `types` property is a list of the OCF Device types that are supported. It comforms to the same syntax constraints as [resource](./client.md/#resource) types. OCF mandates that every device supports at least the properties defined in the `"oic.wk.d"` resource type, that represents a resource for a "basic device". Other specifications, such as the OCF Smart Home Device Specification can define more device types, for instance `"oic.d.fan"`, `"oic.d.thermostat"`, `"oic.d.light"`, `"oic.d.airconditioner"`, etc. The properties exposed by these device types are defined in [oneiota.org](http://www.oneiota.org). The values in `types` may be used in [device discovery](./client.md/#finddevices) filters. For a client-only device `types` is an empty array. When a server device registers a new resource with a new resource type, this property SHOULD be updated by the implementation.

Elements of the `dataModels` property are in the following format: `vertical.major.minor.version` where `major`, `minor` and `version` are numbers and `vertical` is a string. For instance, in the OIC 1.1.0 Core Specification the supported data model version is `"res.1.1.0"`.

The `coreSpecVersion` is `"1.1.0"` in this version of the specification.

### The `OcfPlatform` object
Exposes information about the OCF platform that hosts the current device.

|Property            |Type     |Optional |Default value |Represents            |
| ---                | ---     | ---     | ---          | ---                  |
| `id`               | string  | no  | `undefined` | Platform identifier       |
| `model`            | string  | yes | `undefined` | Model of the hardware     |
| `manufacturerName` | string  | no  | `undefined` | Manufacturer name         |
| `manufacturerLink` | string  | yes | `undefined` | Manufacturer URI          |
| `manufactureDate`  | Date    | yes | `undefined` | Manufacturing date        |
| `vendorId`         | string  | yes | `undefined` | Vendor ID                 |
| `osVersion`        | string  | yes | `undefined` | OS version                |
| `platformVersion`  | string  | yes | `undefined` | Platform version          |
| `firmwareVersion`  | string  | yes | `undefined` | Firmware version          |
| `hardwareVersion`  | string  | yes | `undefined` | Firmware version          |
| `supportURL`       | string  | yes | `undefined` | Product support web page  |
| `datetime`         | Date    | yes | `undefined` | System time of the device |

### Error handling

Errors during OCF network operations are exposed via `onerror` events and `Promise` rejections.

[OCF errors](../README.md#error) are represented as augmented instances of [`Error`](https://nodejs.org/api/errors.html#errors_class_error) objects.

The following [`Error` names](https://nodejs.org/api/errors.html) are used for signaling OCF issues:
- `OcfResourceNotFound` used if the resource cannot be located in the OCF network, or when an observed resource is deleted from the network.
- `OcfDeviceNotFound` used if the device id cannot be located in the OCF network.
- `OcfDiscoveryError` for generic discovery related errors
- `OcfObserveError` for generic observe related errors that are not covered by `OcfResourceNotFound`.
- `OcfResourceError` for other resource related errors.
- `OcfDeviceError` for other device related errors.

The OCF error objects MAY contain two additional optional properties.

| Property       | Type   | Optional | Default value | Represents |
| ---            | ---    | ---      | ---           | ---     |
| `deviceId`     | string | yes      | `undefined`   | UUID of the device |
| `resourcePath` | string | yes      | `undefined`   | URI path of the resource |

- The `deviceId` property is a string that represents the device UUID causing the error. The value `null` means the local device, and the value `undefined` means the error source device is not available.
- The `resourcePath` property is a string that represents the resource path of the [resource](./client.md/#resource) causing the error. If `deviceId` is `undefined`, then the value of `resourcePath` should also be set to `undefined`.
- The `message` property is inherited from `Error`.

The constructor of `OcfDiscoveryError` and `OcfObserveError` takes the following parameters:
- the `message` parameter is a string representing an error message, as with `Error`
- the `deviceId` parameter instantiates the `deviceId` property
- the `resourcePath` parameter instantiates `the resourcePath`.

If `deviceId` is defined, and `resourcePath` is `undefined` or `null`, it means the error is device-specific without being specific to the resource (such as errors realted to device presence).

```javascript
let message = "OCF error";
let deviceId = "0685B960-736F-46F7-BEC0-9E6CBD61ADC1";
let resourcePath = "/myroom/a/light/1";
var err = new OcfObserveError(message, deviceId, resourcePath);
// use `err` in a server response
```

Implementations SHOULD handle the `uncaughtException` event on the process object.

Notes
------

The API uses [Promises](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-promise-objects) with [these notes](../README.md#promise).

The API uses Node.js-style [events](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_events) with [these notes](../README.md#events).

Code using this API is deployed to a device which exposes one or more resources. In this version of the API it is assumed that the execution context of the code is separated for each device.

**Device identification** is UUID.

**Resource identification** is URL path, relative to a given device. A URL composed of the ```oic``` scheme, the device ID as host and the resource path can also be used for identifying a resource: ```oic://<deviceID>/<resourcePath>```. However, this specification uses the device ID and resource ID separately.

**Device discovery** uses endpoint discovery, that is, a multicast request "GET /oic/res" to "All CoAP nodes" (```224.0.1.187``` for IPv4 and ```FF0X::FD``` for IPv6, port 5683). The response lists devices and their resources (at least URI, resource type, interfaces, and media types).

OCF defines special resources on each device, for implementing device discovery, resource discovery, platform discovery, presence, etc. API implementations should encapsulate handling these special resources and the hardcoded/fixed URIs.

This version of the API supports the OCF Core Specification version 1.0 (final) and 1.1.0 (draft), except that it does not yet support OCF resource *links*, *scenes*, *rules* and *scripts*.
