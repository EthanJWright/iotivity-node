Board Support for FRDM-K64F
===========================

This document defines the pin values that are accepted by implementations on board namespace.

The FRDM-K64F board pin names and locations are shown [here](https://developer.mbed.org/platforms/FRDM-K64F/).

There are 16 general purpose I/O pins, `D0` - `D15`. `D14` and `D15` can currently be used as GPIO_INs but not as outputs.

There is an onboard RGB LED which can be controlled through three different GPIO_OUTs for the red, green, and blue components. `LEDR` controls the red portion, `LEDG` the green portion, and `LEDB` the blue
portion. They are all active on high.

There are three onboard switches labeled `SW2`, `SW3`, and `RESET`. The `SW2` switch can be used as a GPIO_IN. The `RESET` switch can be used as an output.

There are ten pins that can be used as PWM output, `PWM0` - `PWM9`.

There are six analog input pins, `A0` - `A5`.

Supported pins are summarized in the following table:
