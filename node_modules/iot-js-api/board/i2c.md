I2C API
=======

The I2C API supports Inter-Integrated Circuit (IIC, I2C), a synchronous serial protocol that allows multiple slave chips to communicate with a master chip. A single I2C bus uses 2 pins, SDA (data) and SCL (clock). Multiple I2C buses may be present on a board, represented as index numbers in this API. Implementations should map the I2C bus to the real pins, using the board documentation.

I2C selects the slave device by addressing: the first byte sent by the master chip contains the 7 bit address of a slave, and one bit for direction (read or write). Slaves acknowledge each byte received from the master by sending 0 on SDA (both SDA and SCL are pulled high in I2C).

If read was requested, the master will emit clock, and the selected slave will provide bits to the master as long as clock is emitted.

If write was requested, the master puts the bit on SDA and sends a clock signal for data available.
Therefore it is important to select the right speed supported by the master and slave devices.
This API uses a [`Buffer`](../README.md/#buffer) object for both read and write.

### The I2C API object
When requiring `"i2c"`, the following steps are run:
- If there is no permission for using the functionality, throw `SecurityError`.
- If the I2C functionality is not supported on the board, throw `"NotSupportedError"`.
- Return an object that implements the following method.

| Method              | Description      |
| ---                 | ---              |
| [`open()`](#open)   | synchronous open |

See also the [Web IDL](./webidl.md) definition.

#### The `I2C open(options)` method
Configures an I2C bus using data provided by the `options` argument. It runs the following steps:
- Let `i2c` be an `I2C`](#i2c) object.
- If `options` is a dictionary and the `options.bus` property is a number between 0 and 127, let `i2c.bus` be `options.bus`, otherwise select the platform default value, and if that is not available, set the value to 0.
- If `options.speed` is not a number, let `i2c.speed` be 10. Otherwise, if it is in the { 10, 100, 400, 1000, 3400 } set, let `i2c.speed` take that value, otherwise set `i2c.speed` to the closest matching value.
- Request the underlying platform to initialize the I2C `bus` with `i2c.speed` on `board`.
- In case of failure, throw `InvalidAccessError`.
- Return `i2c`.

### The `I2C` interface
Represents the properties and methods that expose I2C functionality.

| Property   | Type   | Optional | Default value | Represents |
| ---        | ---    | ---      | ---           | ---        |
| `bus`      | octet  | yes      | platform selected | I2C bus |
| `speed`    | long   | yes      | platform selected | I2C bus speed |

| Method              | Description             |
| ---                 | ---                     |
| [`write()`](#write) | write data to a device  |
| [`read()`](#read)   | read data from a device |
| [`close()`](#close) | close the I2C bus       |

The `bus` property denotes the I2C bus number between 0 and 127.

The `speed` property can take the following numeric values denoting kilobits per second: 10, 100, 400, 1000, 3400.

<a name="write"></a>
#### The `write(device, buffer)` method
Writes a [`Buffer`](../README.md/#buffer) using I2C to slave `device`. The method runs the following steps:
- If `device` is not a number between 0 and 127, throw `TypeError` and terminate these steps.
- Request the underlying platform to write the bytes specified by `buffer` argument to the specified device. If the operation fails, throw `SystemError`.

<a name="read"></a>
#### The `read(device, size)` method
Reads maximum `size` number of bytes from I2C device `device` and returs a [`Buffer`](../README.md/#buffer). The method runs the following steps:
- If `device` is not a number between 0 and 127, throw `TypeError` and terminate these steps.
- Allocate a [`Buffer`](../README.md/#buffer).
- Request the underlying platform to read `size` number of bytes from the specified `device` into `buffer`. If the operation fails, throw `SystemError`.
- Return `buffer`.

<a name="close"></a>
#### The `close()` method
Closes the current [`I2C`](#i2c) bus and cancels all pending operations.

### Examples

```javascript
try {
  var i2c = require("i2c").open();  // open the default I2C bus
  console.log("I2C bus " + i2c.bus + " opened with bus speed " + i2c.speed);

  i2c.write(0x02, [1, 2, 3]);

  var buffer = i2c.read(0x03, 3);
  console.log("From I2C device 0x03: " + buffer.toString());

  i2c.close();
} catch (err) {
  console.log("I2C error: " + err.message);
}
```
